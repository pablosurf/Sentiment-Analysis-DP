The online system of reporting an accident via a smart phone is such a nice thing to have that it‚Äôs convenient, saves time and efforts without having to wait for the police to arrive in such hot weather, while the user experience is pretty cool, easy, friendly and transparent. We are lucky and happy  to have such smart initiatives in today‚Äôs busy life; it makes things so easy and hassle free.
I would like to thank Dubai Police for their wonderful services been provided to the public. Most of the time it goes un noticed how they keeps all residents safe on the roads or even helps our families to have a safe nights sleep with the safety provided around where we live to.
Eid Mubarak to all Muslims,
Dubai police, today I thank you for the efforts you put in order to keep us safe and on right path. Your advanced technology is the best I have come across. Swift approach to incidents are just something one would only imagine but you have made it in real life.. salute to all Men and Women in uniform. Am proud to be in Dubai
Dear team,
In accident report there is no option for reporting of accident when only one vehicle in involved. For example if while reversing car hits some wall.
I recommend all who lives in Dubai to download and use this site
The dubai police app was already perfect. There‚Äôs a saying that it‚Äôs very difficult to improve perfection, and this is what this app is doing. We always see an improved perfection of something that is already flawless. Ease of use, Swift and responsive one the best app experience. Thanks
Excellent user interface which is intuitive, comprehensive and responsive. All information is just few clicks away. Very happy to use it and pleased to recommend it to others.
Best police in the world. Thank you for this amazing app. Trying to drive without fine for 1 year to make our fines 0 aed. For my wife it is remaining 2 weeks and all fines will be 0. Best service, Dubai amazing city, More high then Dubai Police security and service just Everest Mountains))) All the best. God bless you and UAE country!
Im an expat born in the UAE, and Ive seen the transition the country has gone through over the years. One of the best initiatives of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid was the the digitization of all government services.
I force a problem on The app . Its not working on my phone since last update .i tried so many time by all ways to start the app but without any respond .
Dubai Police, never stops to amaze me.. I always look up to with high respect.. Thank you soo much for keeping us safe.. UAE for me is my second home away from home.  Keep up the good job like you always do. ‚ù§Ô∏è Salute üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I had fraudulent transactions on my bank account and my bank told me to go to the police station to open a case. I got there and was not helped very well at all. I was just told to download the Dubai police app and do it online. Till now, I am still struggling to log the case.
As DUBAI POLICE with all the dedication and highly train to understand with care and making the safe city .. we wish them all the best and a great future ..
Hats off to Dubai police. The dedication and   Service by DUBAI police  is highly commendable.  They take care law and order strictly at the same time respect the people and are always there at service when in need.
I had an accident since yesterday 4pm and I submitted all details on the application and until now 48 hours later I haven‚Äôt received the accident report. I‚Äôm calling all police and traffic numbers and not able to reach any answer. It was a lot better when the police used to come and finish everything at the accident location.
Just installed, app starts but non of the buttons work.
Thank you for using Dubai Police App, Kindly update the App...
Thanks for Dubai police for there wonderful services and the very respectful way they r dealing with us really they deserve to be number one among all the police globally thanks again and god bless all of you
Very good police, car was very spacious and comfortable. Handcuffs weren‚Äôt too tight, and handled my case very well and jail cell was very clean, and cell mate very nice. 10/10, would get arrested again with them for sure.
This application takes forever and for people who don‚Äôt have internet are crippled to report anything. Plus this application asks to control your photos ? It‚Äôs my personal thing why would I allow you to peep into my mobile ? Another way of controlling people‚Äôs personal data.
Thanks for your hand work and being there for everyone in the need of help... best police in the world... thanks to His Highness sh Mohammed for letting us expat feeling more secure then our own countries..
I got 500 fine and i dont know y,  I save every 5aed 10 aed wherever i can  for my family commitment and when i get huge fine like 500 it breaks me completely...atleast a warning letter or anything like that would be good for people who do mistakes unknowingly..
Really moved by the way Dubai Police has raised funds to release the poor prisoners caught up with money defaults etc!!! Dubai is constantly setting examples! Keep up the excellent worküëç
I‚Äôm talking about live chat or asking from amna which works same like siri but this application can not reply properly even though if you ask for any simple thing there is no answer with it
I used chat service no one answer and I‚Äôve called traffic department because we have traffic fine 3ticket all tickets are at the sale time  , also no one pick up phone.
I had an accident 2 days ago till now the accident report is not ready and I need it to fix the car. Also I requested the call me back and got a confirmation that I will get a call shortly. Now it is more than 24 hours and I didn‚Äôt get any calls. It is supposed to be smart but unfortunately it is not.
Thank you for using Dubai Police App, sorry for the inconvenience, if you still didn't receive the Accident Report, kindly provide it here or call our customer service on 901
Thank you your Highness Sheikh. Mohamed bin Rashed Al-Maktoum for all you did to Dubai and peopled on this land...
If you drive in the UAE and you‚Äôve got some fines. Use this app, and check it regularly. I got some good discounts on my RTA violations and that went a long way to relieve me in settling my bills.
An app which completes all the necessities as well guides and ease the transaction and actions required for daily life .ease in reporting everythg directly without the hussle of being in queue
You are forcing people to watch the small video while opening the app , I for example only need to check the fines , and it‚Äôs really frustrated to watch the small video in the beginning and it‚Äôs really slow hope you remove it or see any other alternative
Congratulations to DUBAI Police for winning the Prize of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammad for smart governments. Thanks goes to Chief Abdallah and all his team for making DUBAI a safer place to live in. All the best and good luck for the future.
Hi, imI believe is excellent app and other countries can learn from how accessible and efficient the Dubai Police App is.
The first phase of app was amazing, gradually over the years; the app has been even slow and too much waiting time to check for any updates. Wish if they can make it a more smooth experience interface for its consumers.
I am unable to use the We Are All Police app without enabling the camera. How am i supposed to use camera while driving?! I can only report an offense when i am stopped a d by that time the car is not there. How can i use the app?
I am one of the many Dubai residents and really appreciate the outstanding service that Dubai Police always provides to its citizens & residents.
This is the second time when the app is giving error and I had to go for station for minor accident. Plus the call center people 911 & 901 are not helpful at all. They don‚Äôt want to work at all!
Their app is too slow so if you want to signal something wrong you will definitely not have time.
The app doesn‚Äôt let me submit the request. I have tried thousand times. It‚Äôs awful experience, especially when you have lost your phone and that‚Äôs the only help that u can rely on to!!!
Dubai Police app is so comprehensive and simple to use.
Thank you for using Dubai Police App, Kindly update the App...
i went to dubai police al barsha, i got in minute only my loss certificate and a new plate number in rta, without queue. amazing experience! thank you dubai police for your service.
It was very annoying to renew my vehicle registration through the applications app., even contacting police offc. Was hard as nobody answering.. till now since morning I am trying to register my vehicle and I cannot.
Dubai police is one of the best force in the world.

The app is too heavy and full of flash based animation which make it very heavy. Effort should be spent on making it light and more user friendly.

Super inconvenient
A successful and beneficial program. We wish you success and always ahead. God made this country safe and secure, Lord of the worlds
The application is excellent and the Dubai Police is very excellent, good luck and forward
The application is excellent and the Dubai Police is very, very excellent
The application is not running
The application does not work on my device after the last update, as it exits automatically after opening the application directly, and the problem is with most of my friends
Impractical application
slow
Entering the service requires several steps. Animation at first is not important. Bad (secure) screen service, please delete it or set it as an optional service so that we do not have to skip each time
The option to change the language to Arabic where it is.Please design a modern interface with a useful, easy-to-access service. You don't need to put in too many big pictures and having to drag the screen too much like a photo album or game program. Read about the applications of official and government institutions and make a design appropriate for a government institution
Sometimes it does not work. Several times I received a message that I am outside Dubai, knowing that I live in Liwan
Violations paid and they asked me to wait for what I received. Thank you, government and people
Report an accident. The system cannot be dealt with in the border region between Dubai and Sharjah
Community security. The police are the internal safety valve for any society. May God bless you and protect you
Excellence is your address
The application is very easy and convenient even when inquiring about traffic violations, and it is distinguished from the services that provide it that serve our daily requirements, facilitate it, simplify it a lot and make it more comfortable. Thank you, Dubai Police
Dubai Police. God bless you
Abu Dhabi. Emirates of goodness country and year of tolerance
Creative Dubai Police, thank you
I could not pay the violations after 100 attempts
Excellent. Great effort and one step of the future
Dubai, excellent
Thank you, Sir, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Thanks to the police and security leaders in Dubai. Thanks to all the members of the police and security. Thank you to everyone who contributed to maintaining the security of Dubai. God bless you and protect you ...
A distinguished service established for mass communication in the most elegant ways. My best wishes for success and prosperity forever
technical problems. A technical problem occurs when trying to push violations
Stop it. You have a very easy procedure for all transactions, so dealing with employees in police stations is very beautiful. Honesty is the utmost respect.
The best police app in the world
Thank you, I hope that the application will be activated on the faceprint system
We are all police the best application
Great. I love Dubai police
Thank you, Dubai Police. A very wonderful application, all thanks, and appreciation to the Dubai Police
Thank you, a wonderful program
A little note. Please enter the image service for the violations so that the customer is comfortable and is sure that the violation is correct 100/100
May God‚Äôs peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. We were very happy, as parents, with your care and keenness in teaching our children the diving course in the summer program. May God reward you.
Routine. Why do I need to check out Abu Dhabi Lin Dubai to pay a strike for Locke?. And why on the car number day is given to a second person to look into the violations of the old owner. And I who change and review in order to save someone's problem !!
Excellent
traffic accident. I did an accident today morning, I used the application, I did not have a net during the accident, I took pictures of the car and the car that caused the accident, the application you cannot download the photos, you need to take a picture immediately and without the net what the application works
Thank you, Dubai Police, for your great effort, permanent development, and services. Thank you from the heart
Violations. The program does not work for me. Developer Response. Thanks, for your use of the Dubai Police application, please let us know the type of mobile phone and update the operating system to the latest version
There is no Arabic language. I could not convert to Arabic.
Excellent app. Easy quick
The absence of a discount on the violations that are outside the Emirate of Dubai, and I wish that after a month, the violation will be reduced
Thanks, Dubai Police form the deep of my heart I hope you more
